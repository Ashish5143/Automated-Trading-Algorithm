# Automated-Trading-Algorithm

It is an algorithm developed for FOREX Trading or Foreign Exchange market. The strategy is developed using Python using various technical indicators that provides trading signals. The buying signal is generated by the algorithm when we have more than or equal to 2 Renko bars along with MACD value greater than MACD Signal value and slope of MACD is also greater than slope of MACD Signal.
The selling signal is generated by the algorithm when Renko bars are less than or equal to -2 along with MACD slope less than MACD Signal slope.

For caluculating brick size Average True Range (ATR) is used. The size of the brick depends upon the Trader.
The algorithm initially checks if we have any existing position or not i.e long or short position and if not then it will generate the Trading signal based on the technical indicators and performs the trade automatically without any manual intervention.

The return signals are empty, buy, sell, close_buy and close_sell.
